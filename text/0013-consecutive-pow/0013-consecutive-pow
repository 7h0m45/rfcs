## Summary

Banning consecutive PoW blocks will empower PoS security as the dominant security method for Peercoin.

## Conventions
- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Motivation

The Peercoin network uses the same hashing algorithm as PoW dominant chains such as Bitcoin, but its security is known to be PoS-dominant.
PoW in Peercoin is used only as a method of distribution, so a consecutive stream of PoW blocks threatens that paradigm.
In the current state of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, it is easiest for large miners to avoid the Peercoin network until the hash power vrs price is low enough to make a profit, then move their hash power onto the network and spike the PoW difficulty with several blocks in succession.
This has resulted in a large number of consecutive PoW blocks from a single source that threaten the security of the chain, as well as large reorgs of 6 or more blocks as PoS blocks replace the PoW string with higher chain weight.

## Detailed design

The Peercoin network will ban consecutive PoW blocks, such that any PoW blocks built ontop of other PoW blocks will be orphaned.
The result will be that, going forward, each PoW block must be preceded and followed by a PoS block.

## Drawbacks

Otherwise valid PoW blocks will be rejected.
This may reduce miner participation, which is a serious concern given that lack of a continuous miner participation is the primary reason this RFC is being proposed in the first place.
On the other hand, it could be argued that this RFC will prevent miners from having large strings of PoW blocks orphaned unexpectedly by a single higher chainweight PoS block.
This RFC will mostly affect large changes in PoW difficulty, and under conditions of constant difficulty will only cause a small stochastic increase in PoW orphan frequency.

## Alternatives

Only counting PoS blocks when calculating the 6-block transaction validity will also prevent double-spends in the event of a large miner moving to the Peercoin network, even if a string of consecutive PoW blocks are found.
This method will not affect miners negatively as the current proposal would, but it could result in longer and less-intuitive wait times for the right type of confirmations.
